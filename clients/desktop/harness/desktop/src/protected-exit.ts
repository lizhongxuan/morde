/**
 * The protected exit: what runs between a person asking to quit or restart
 * for an update and the quit itself. One flow, one busy judgment, for
 * both: close the gate so no new work starts under the hand-over, ask before
 * ending what is running, with keeping it running as the default, and only
 * on an explicit confirmation end the work, wait for it to end, and complete
 * the exit. Cancelling opens the gate again and nothing has stopped.
 *
 * Closing the window to stay in the tray, sitting idle, a crash and the system
 * switching off never come through here: they are not an exit request, and
 * `approval` stays `none` for them. `approval` says only that the person
 * confirmed this exit; it does not say the stop finished every piece of work.
 * For ordinary quit, when the stop's deadline or the rounds ran out with work still on, the log
 * carries "work still on after the stop" and the Host ends what remains.
 * Either update installation requires acknowledged work state and a completed stop,
 * and keeps the gate closed until installation takes over.
